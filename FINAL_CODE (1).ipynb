    "    Because the Genetic Algorithm is so computationally expensive, it is unfeasable to run every permutation of model type, and level until the point where the model can complete the level. Currently we have it set up so that one model will be chosen to be trained on one level, which can be selected using the variables below. Feel free to change the values to whichever choice you like, though we recommend using model_type = 4 as it on average takes the fewest number of generations to train. We also do not recommend choosing level = 5 as the model will take many generation to progress significantly through the level, and will take at least a few hours of training to complete it.\n",
